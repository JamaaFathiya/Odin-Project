		<p>Chin Chin – West African Fried pastry enjoyed throughout the region especially in Nigeria- Crispy Crunchy and Addictive</p>
		<p>Chin chin is my all time favorite snack -it  tastes so good , yet so bad for you .It is a scrumptious fried pastry made in various ways. Throughout West Africa and Nigeria Chin Chin originally was prepared for special occasions. It has evolved from a special occasion food to being a snack food, sold on street corners, kiosk and supermarkets.</p>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>3 1/2 cups 440 grams all-Purpose flour</li>
			<li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
			<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
			<li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
			<li>1- teaspoon grated nutmeg</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon grated lime zest</li>
			<li>1/4 cup or 4 tablespoons margarine/butter</li>
			<li>1 large egg</li>
			<li>3/4 cup milk</li>
			<li>oil for frying</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Using a mixer or by hand mix the dry ingredients; flour, baking powder, salt, sugar, nutmeg and lime zest</li>
			<li>Add the butter to the flour and mix well until the butter is well incorporated with the flour.</li>
			<li>Add milk and egg into the mixture. Keep mixing until you have formed a sticky dough bal</li>
			<li>Dump the dough ball onto a floured surface and knead, incorporating more flour into the dough as needed, until the dough is smooth, elastic, and even in color and no longer sticky. Chin-chin can be cut into many shapes and sizes</li>
			<li>Divide dough in half .On a floured board roll each half about 1/6 inches thick. Just like linguine or fettuccine. You can make it easy by using a pasta machine if you have one available. Make shapes as desired.</li>
			<li>Add oil (about 3 inches deep) to a heated skillet/sauce pan or my all time favorite Dutch oven that is over medium heat and bring it to 375 degrees .</li>
			<li>Fry in hot oil until golden .Remove from oil, drain, and serve. You can store this in an air tight container for up to a month.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Tips & Notes:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>For this recipe , I used a standard measuring cup( leveled ). I also used standard measuring spoons.</li>
			<li>If you like your chin soft then add more butter – 1 or 2 Tablespoons more . Be careful not to use too much butter . If not your chin chin is going to crumble.</li>
			<li>A pasta machine helps in rolling out the dough and shaping it.</li>
		</ol>
